# Analize concept small k8s platform

## Platform Minikube

 You start the cluster using ```minikube start```, wait a few minutes and your kubectl is ready to go. To specify a Kubernetes version you can use the ```--kubernetes-version``` flag.

      Master <|-- Pod1
      Master <|-- Pod2
      Master : Cluster
      Master : Minikube
      Master: Kubectl (..)
      class Pod1{
         %% +String beakColor
         %% +swim()
         %% +quack()
      }
      class Pod2{
         %% -int sizeInFeet
         %% -canEat()
      }
```

## Platform Kind

Creating a cluster is very similar to minikubeâ€™s approach. Executing kind ```create cluster```, playing the waiting game and afterwards you are good to go. By using ```different names (--name)``` kind allows you to create multiple instances in parallel.

One feature that I personally enjoy is the ability to load my local images directly into the cluster. This saves me a few extra steps of setting up a registry and pushing my image each and every time I want to try out my changes. With a simple ```kind load docker-image my-app:latest``` the image is available for use in my cluster.

### Nodes

```mermaid
classDiagram
      Master <|-- Worker 1
      Master <|-- Worker 2
      class Worker 1{
          Pod 1* 
          Pod 2* 
         %% +quack()
      }
      class Worker 2{
          Pod 3* 
          Pod 4* 
      }
```

## Platform K3d

  K3d is the alternative to Kubeadm. Utility designed to easily run multi-node K3s clusters in Docker.
  The application is split into the K3d server and the agent. The former acts as a manager while the latter is responsible for handling the actual workload. I discourage you from running them on your workstation as this leads to some cluster in your local filesystem. Instead put K3d in a container (e.g. by using rancher/K3d) which also allows you to easily run several independent instances.

### WM cluster

```mermaid
classDiagram
      Master <|-- Worker 1
      Master <|-- Worker 2
      Master : Docker
      Master : Kubelet (..)
      Master : Kubeadm (..)
      Master : Kubectl (..)
      class Worker 1{
          Docker
          Kubectl
          Pod (1)* 
          Pod (2)* 
         %% +quack()
      }
      class Worker 2{
          Docker
          Kubectl
          Pod (3)* 
          Pod (4)* 
      }
```

One feature that stands out is called auto deployment. It allows you to deploy your Kubernetes manifests and Helm charts by putting them in a specific directory. K3d watches for changes and takes care of applying them without any further interaction. This is especially useful for CI pipelines and IoT devices (both target use cases of K3d). Just create/update your configuration and K3d makes sure to keep your deployments up to date.
